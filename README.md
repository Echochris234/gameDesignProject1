## Game Narrative

**I. Main Character: Tony Giovanni**

Tony Giovanni is a 25-year old New Yorker who works at a bodega in
Bensonhurst. He attends classes part time at Kingsborough
Community College and is working towards his associate degree in
criminal justice in order to start his career as a police officer.

Outside of work and school, Tony enjoys spending time with his
girlfriend Daniella Marie Gargiulo, playing video games, and
hanging out with his friends, most of which he’s known since
kindergarten at Our Lady of Guadalupe. Still, despite everything
going on in his life, he still makes time to spend with his family, and
wouldn’t dare skip Sunday dinners with the family (his mother would
kill him if he even suggested it!).

**II. Back Story**

While working at the bodega on the night before Halloween, a
hooded customer walks in looking what Tony could only call
“busted”: beat up Timbs, tattered puffer jacket, dirty jeans, and a
tank that’s seen better days. Tony, having seen worse, shrugged it off
and continued taking inventory. When the customer finished getting
his stuff, Tony noticed that he picked up the staples: an Arizona iced
tea, a bag of chips, a chopped cheese, a baconeggandcheese,
and a two-ride MetroCard. Tony gave him the price: $7.50. The
customer, in a voice so raspy that Tony was surprised he didn’t buy a
pack of Newport’s, asked “Yo, can you do me a solid and cover
me?”. Despite being a devout Catholic, Tony knew that business was
business, and freebies didn’t pay the bills (also, Ock would have a
few words to say if he did), so he shook his head no. The customer
asked again, but Tony didn’t change his answer. Getting frustrated,
the customer reached into his jacket and pulled out...a domino. He
slams it on the counter before walking out, slamming the door
behind him. Tony picked up the domino, which, unlike the classic
black and white ones, had sharp edges, was dark red, and had skulls


for the dots. While examining the domino, Tony noticed that it got
warmer and warmer to the touch. However, before he had the
chance to put it down, a powerful force pulled him in, leaving the
bodega completely empty.

When Tony comes to, he looks around and is thankful that he’s still in
New York...that is until he sees the overgrown rats and pigeons
running straight toward him, hellbent on attacking him. Running as
quickly as he can away from the beasts, he runs into the Ock that
runs the bodega where he works. Thankful to see a familiar face,
Tony begins telling his boss about the customer and the domino. His
boss nodded, but instead of reassuring him, he says in a thick Arabic
accent, “You encountered an evil spirit. They tend to be more
devious the closer it is to Halloween when their powers are more
potent. Also, I’m not your boss; just a version of him in this alternate
New York.” Seeing the horror on Tony’s face, the alternate-world Ock
tries to offer him some hope: “Getting back to the real New York is
possible. All you have to do is get through the five alternate
boroughs, defeat the spirit that sent you here, and don’t get killed on
the way. Good luck with the rats though. I really thought they
couldn’t get any bigger”. With that, his boss disappears. Feeling
somewhat reassured that he can return to his city, Tony ties up his
laces, and begins making his way through the first borough.


## Gameplay Overview

**I. Main Objective**

In “No Sleep til’ Brooklyn” (NSTB), the player must help Tony
successfully get through each of the five boroughs of New York
(Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island), and
defeat the evil spirit that banished him to the alternate New York in
order to return to his home in Brooklyn. It is appropriate for players 10
and up who are looking for a comedic and appropriately
challenging goal-based game. Depending on player ability, it
should take approximately 5 – 10 minutes to complete each
borough, with total gameplay averaging about one-hour minimum.

**II. Short-term Goal**

The player must collect the following five objects that will allow Tony
to leave each borough and progress to the next:

- MetroCard
- Arizona iced tea
- baconeggandcheese
- chopped cheese sandwich
- city bus

**III. Mid-term Goal**

The player must avoid the enemy NPC rats and pigeons that will
result in a lost life if collided with.

**IV. Long-term Goal**

The player much reach Staten Island and defeat the evil spirit that
sent him to the alternate New York. Upon successful completion, the
player is transported back to the real New York, beats the game,
and the game ends.


## Mechanics

**I. Abilities**

The player can control Tony’s movements using the following keys:

- _D key_ : forward movement
- _A key_ : backward movement
- _Space_ : jumping

**II. Assets and Attributes**

The primary attribute in the game are three hearts that represent
lives. When the player collides with an enemy NPC, a life is lost. The
game ends when all three lives are depleted.

The assets are the five items listed within the “Short-Term Goal”
section.

**III. Obstacles**

The obstacles are the NPC rats and pigeons that the player must
dodge to avoid losing a life.


## Dynamics

**I. Required Hardware**

NSTB can be played on a desktop or laptop computer that runs on

Mac OS or Windows OS and is equipped with a functional keyboard

and mouse or trackpad. The player can control Tony with the keys

noted in the “Abilities” subtopic of the “Mechanics” section.


## Game Development

**I. Development Environment**

NSTB was created using C# in the Unity game engine.

**II. Development Sequence**

The following shows a tentative, unordered list of development goals

that must be accomplished to produce a playable prototype. This list

does not include playtests between the addition of new mechanics:

- Program main character movements (see “Mechanics”)
- Program tutorial level(s) and puzzles
- Program enemy NPC movements
- Implement UI
    o Health hearts
    o Start screen
    o Game over screen
    o Menu system
- Record and add music and sound effects
- Develop new levels with appropriately increased difficulty


## Aesthetics

**II. Game World**

The game takes place in an alternate New York City where the evil

presences roam rampantly. The backdrop will reflect the boroughs
